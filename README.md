Clean and format extracted data: Eliminate messy line breaks and duplicate entries.
Export data to CSV or other formats: Easily transfer extracted information to your CRM or contact management system.
Getting started:

Install requirements: Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (see requirements.txt file for details).
Run the script: Run python bizcard_extract.py in your terminal.

Export data: Choose your preferred format and save the extracted data for further use.
Optional features:

Command-line mode: Run BizCard Extract without a graphical interface for batch processing of images.
